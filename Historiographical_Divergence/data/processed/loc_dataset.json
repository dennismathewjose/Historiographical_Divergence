Smith called Lincoln's attention to a circular distributed before the election by “respectable citizens of New York,” in which Lincoln was held up as a dangerous radical and an enemy of the institutions of the South and of the peace and security of the Union, whose policies were unsettling to the commercial life of the country.  Such a message, typical as it was of the sort of vituperation a presidential candidate must endure, was especially unsettling in the current campaign, and would have a negative influence in the South as well as among Northern voters.  Once elected, Smith asked, should Lincoln not speak out to “disarm the mischief makers, to allay causeless anxiety, to compose the public mind...?”\n(copy)\nPrivate & Confidential\nSpringfield Ill Nov 10th 1860.\nMy dear Sir\nThis is intended as a strictly private letter to you, and not as an answer to yours brought me by Mr. Sanford.\nIt is with the most profound appreciation of your motive, and highest respect for your judgment too, that I feel constrained, for the present, at least, to make no declaration for the public.\n2 Smith's first letter to Lincoln, of November 7, 1860, was carried by Henry S. Sanford.  See Smith to Lincoln, November 8, 1860.\nFirst, I could say nothing which I have not already said, and which is in print, and open for the inspection of all.  To press a repetition of this upon those who\nhave\nlistened, is useless; to press it upon those who have\nrefused\nto listen, and still refuse, would be wanting in self-respect, and would have an appearance of sycophancy and timidity, which would excite the contempt of good men, and encourage bad ones to clamor the more loudly.\nI am not insensible to any commercial or financial depression that may exist; but nothing is to be gained by fawning around the “\nrespectable scoundrels\n” who got it up.  Let them go to work and repair the mischief of their own making; and then perhaps they will be less greedy to do the like again.\nYours very truly\nA. Lincoln."

Theodore Talbot, U. S. Army, and arrived at Charleston, S. C. on Monday at the same hour.  Finding that Fort Sumter had neither been surrendered, evacuated nor attacked, I immediately thro' Capt.

Govr. Pickens received the Copy and said he would submit it to General Beauregard, he having, since the ratification of the Constitution of the Confederate States by South Carolina, been placed in charge of the Military operations in this vicinity—  Genl.

We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow, this ground—The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they did here.\nIt is rather for us, the living, we here be dedicated to the great task remaining before us —that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\n(Differences between the texts of the two drafts are indicated by emphasis type.

General Correspondence. 1837-1897: Abraham Lincoln, [March 4, 1865] (Second Inaugural Address; endorsed by Lincoln, April 10, 1865)\nWashington, DC, 1999.\nPreceding element provides place and date of transcription only.\nFor more information about this text and this American Memory collection, refer to accompanying matter.\nCopyright status not determined; refer to accompanying matter.\nThis transcription is intended to have an accuracy rate of 99.95 percent or greater and is not intended to reproduce the appearance of the original work. The accompanying images provide a facsimile of this work and represent the appearance of the original.\n1999/05/20\n0001\nAbraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address\n, [March 4, 1865]\n1 The only known manuscript of Lincoln's famous Second Inaugural Address, this document appears to be a fair copy, rather than a composition draft.  Its large lettering and well-spaced lines suggest it was copied out fair as a reading copy.  This is confirmed by the revision he made to the address's ending, which could have been effected by inserting additional words between the lines.  Instead, he made the revision by pasting a slip of paper, or tab, over the last two lines of his text and writing the revised version on the tab.\nAt some point it was decided to make printed copies available to the press.  The name written in pencil in the top margin of the first page of the manuscript, “Flynn,” is almost certainly that of the typesetter assigned by the printer to set the manuscript into type.  After proofreading the galleys of what would become a three-page printed handout for the press, Lincoln seems to have retained a set of uncorrected galleys and fashioned this into his reading copy.  He did this by cutting the printed galleys up into smaller segments (mostly consisting of one sentence), arranging them into two columns, and pasting them onto a larger sheet.  The text of this reading copy shows two verbal changes, which are present also in the manuscript copy, and many punctuation changes, which are not.  This is presumably the text that Lincoln read from at the inaugural ceremony at the Capitol on March 4, 1865.\nThe text of the manuscript is followed by that of the reading copy.\nManuscript copy\nFellow Countrymen\n2 In pencil, possibly in another hand.\nAt this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.  Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.  Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention, and engrosses the enerergies of the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil-war.  All dreaded it — all sought to avert it.  While the inaugeral address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to\nsaving\nthe Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to\ndestroy\nit without war — seeking to dissole the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.  Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would\nmake\nwar rather than let the nation survive; and the other would\naccept\nwar rather than let it perish.  And the war came.\nOne eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern\nhalf\npart of it.  These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.  Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the\ncause\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.  It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully.  The Almighty has His own purposes.  “Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!”  If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in\na Living God always ascribe to Him?  Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray — that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.  Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said\nour\n] three thousand years ago, so still it must be said “the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether”\nWith malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan —\nto achieve and cherish a lasting peace among ourselves and with the world.\nto do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with\nthe world.\nall nations.\n3 Lincoln revised his text by covering the last two lines (“to achieve . . .the world.”) with a tab, on which he wrote the revised ending (“to do all . . . the world.”).  A further change was made on the tab itself by striking “the world”  and substituting “all nations.”\nEndorsed by Lincoln:\nOriginal manuscript\nof second Inaugeral presented to Major John Hay.\n4 Lincoln's characterization of this document as the “original manuscript” must be regarded with some latitude, as the manuscript gives every evidence of being a fair copy, made from an earlier composition draft.  It is undoubtedly the manuscript from which the printed reading copy was set.\nA. Lincoln\nApril 10, 1865\nPrinted Reading Copy\n5 Whether Lincoln planned to have his manuscript set up in print to read from, or decided to take advantage of the advance printing for the press handout, is not known.  Comparison with the press handout shows this reading copy to be an uncorrected galley proof in which the printer had already made a number of minor changes in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, many of which Lincoln accepted. The additional punctuation, particularly the commas added at this late stage, probably reflects Lincoln's characteristic concern for the most effective pace and delivery.\nA list of all changes appears at the end of the text.\nFELLOW COUNTRYMEN: At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.  Then, a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth, on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention, and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented.

This suggests that Lincoln made most of these changes after he had made corrections on another set of corrected galleys sent to the printer.  Differences between this text and that of the holograph manuscript are of two types: A. Changes made by Lincoln to his own manuscript text.  B. Changes made by the printer, some of which were accepted and some rejected by Lincoln. A list of the changes in each category follows:\nA. Changes made here by Lincoln to his manuscript text:\nWord changes: “half”  changed to “part”; “the world”  changed to “all nations” (these changes were also made in the manuscript).  Commas added after “called forth”; “peculiar”; “this interest”; “to do more”; “that of neither”;\n“cherish”.  Semi-colon substituted for comma after “wills to remove”.\nB. Changes made by the printer:\nAccepted by Lincoln\n: comma added after “Then”; “civil war”  for manuscript's “civil-war”; “energies” for the manuscript's “enerergies”;“inaugural”  for the manuscript's “inaugeral”; “dissolve”  for the manuscript's “dissole”; “One-eighth”  for manuscript's “One eighth”; comma deleted after “perpetuate”; comma added after “judge not”; dash after “answered”  (substituted for Lincoln's semi-colon); period after “cometh”  (substituted for Lincoln's exclamation point); initial capitals changed to lower case in “southern”, “slavery”, “north”, “south”, and “living”; comma after “north and south” deleted; comma after “continue”  deleted; “bondman's”  for manuscript's “bond-man's”; comma added after “must be said”; comma after “Lord”  deleted; period added after “altogether”; comma after “cherish a just” deleted.\nRejected by Lincoln\nComma deleted after “attention”  restored by Lincoln; comma substituted for semi-colon after “even by war”  changed back to semi-colon by Lincoln; comma deleted after “for the war”  restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after “magnitude”  restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after “duration”  restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after “triumph” restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after “Bible”  restored by Lincoln; semi-colon changed to comma after “same God”  restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after “lash” restored by Lincoln; comma deleted after “lasting peace” restored by Lincoln."

    "content": "We meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart. The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the principal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace whose joyous expression can not be restrained. In the midst of this, however, He from whom all blessings flow, must not be forgotten. A call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly promulgated. Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of rejoicing, be overlooked. Their honors must not be parcelled out with others. I myself was near the front, and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you; but no part of the honor, for plan or execution, is mine. To Gen. Grant, his skillful officers, and brave men, all belongs. The gallant Navy stood ready, but was not in reach to take active part.\nBy these recent successes the re-inauguration of the national authority -- reconstruction -- which has had a large share of thought from the first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is fraught with great difficulty. Unlike a case of a war between independent nations, there is no authorized organ for us to treat with. No one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with, and mould from, disorganized and discordant elements. Nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ among ourselves as to the mode, manner, and means of reconstruction."
