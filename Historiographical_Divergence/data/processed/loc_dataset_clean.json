Smith called Lincoln's attention to a circular distributed before the election by “respectable citizens of New York,” in which Lincoln was held up as a dangerous radical and an enemy of the institutions of the South and of the peace and security of the Union, whose policies were unsettling to the commercial life of the country.  Such a message, typical as it was of the sort of vituperation a presidential candidate must endure, was especially unsettling in the current campaign, and would have a negative influence in the South as well as among Northern voters.  Once elected, Smith asked, should Lincoln not speak out to “disarm the mischief makers, to allay causeless anxiety, to compose the public mind...?”\n(copy)\nPrivate & Confidential\nSpringfield Ill Nov 10th 1860.\nMy dear Sir\nThis is intended as a strictly private letter to you, and not as an answer to yours brought me by Mr. Sanford.\nIt is with the most profound appreciation of your motive, and highest respect for your judgment too, that I feel constrained, for the present, at least, to make no declaration for the public.\n2 Smith's first letter to Lincoln, of November 7, 1860, was carried by Henry S. Sanford.  See Smith to Lincoln, November 8, 1860.\nFirst, I could say nothing which I have not already said, and which is in print, and open for the inspection of all.  To press a repetition of this upon those who\nhave\nlistened, is useless; to press it upon those who have\nrefused\nto listen, and still refuse, would be wanting in self-respect, and would have an appearance of sycophancy and timidity, which would excite the contempt of good men, and encourage bad ones to clamor the more loudly.\nI am not insensible to any commercial or financial depression that may exist; but nothing is to be gained by fawning around the “\nrespectable scoundrels\n” who got it up.  Let them go to work and repair the mischief of their own making; and then perhaps they will be less greedy to do the like again.\nYours very truly\nA. Lincoln."

April 8th 1861\nTo The President\nUnder the foregoing orders I left Washington at 6 P.M. Saturday April 6th, 1861, in company with Capt. Theodore Talbot, U. S. Army, and arrived at Charleston, S. C. on Monday at the same hour.  Finding that Fort Sumter had neither been surrendered, evacuated nor attacked, I immediately thro' Capt. Talbot, requested an interview with Governor Pickens, which was at once accorded to me, and I then read to him the portion of said orders in italics, and delivered to him the copy of the same which was furnished to me for that purpose, in the presence of Capt Talbot.  Govr. Pickens received the Copy and said he would submit it to General Beauregard, he having, since the ratification of the Constitution of the Confederate States by South Carolina, been placed in charge of the Military operations in this vicinity—  Genl. Beauregard was accordingly sent for, and the Governor read the paper to him.\nIn reply to a remark made by Governor Pickens in reference to an answer I informed him that I was not authorised to receive any communication from him in reply—\nRespectfully submitted\nR.

We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow, this ground—The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they did here.\nIt is rather for us, the living, we here be dedicated to the great task remaining before us —that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\n(Differences between the texts of the two drafts are indicated by emphasis type.

    "content": "FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.  Then, a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth, on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention, and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war.  All dreaded it — all sought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to\nsaving\nthe Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to\ndestroy\nit without war — seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.  Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would\nmake\nwar rather than let the nation survive; and the other would\naccept\nwar rather than let it perish. And the war came.\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the southern\nhalf\npart of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar, and powerful interest.  All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war.  To strengthen, perpetuate and extend this interest, was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more, than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the\ncause\nof the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.  It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be answered — that of neither, has been answered fully.  The Almighty has His own purposes. “\nWoe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh.”   If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove; and that He gives to both north and south this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him?  Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray — that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.  Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, “the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”\nWith malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish, a just and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with\nthe world.\nall nations."

    "content": "We meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart. The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the principal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace whose joyous expression can not be restrained. In the midst of this, however, He from whom all blessings flow, must not be forgotten. A call for a national thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly promulgated. Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of rejoicing, be overlooked. Their honors must not be parcelled out with others. I myself was near the front, and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you; but no part of the honor, for plan or execution, is mine. To Gen. Grant, his skillful officers, and brave men, all belongs. The gallant Navy stood ready, but was not in reach to take active part.\nBy these recent successes the re-inauguration of the national authority -- reconstruction -- which has had a large share of thought from the first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is fraught with great difficulty. Unlike a case of a war between independent nations, there is no authorized organ for us to treat with. No one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with, and mould from, disorganized and discordant elements. Nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ among ourselves as to the mode, manner, and means of reconstruction."
